## I dont really know what to put here, so I will just put extensions of my journal ##

## START OF "Research research research" ##
Main pedals I looked into were VRS, HU+, SIMNET, SIMJACK and VNM

VRS
  My initial favourite
  of the sample of brakes to investigate
  only the vrs didn't use elastomers, instead --> bell crank
  this forces the load cell to be placed on the pedal arm itself
  this allows the user to fully control the brake force curve and ensure linearity - which helps consistency
  this may also be more cost effective in the long run as it provides infinite customizability without having to shell out for elastomers when it comes to the brake force
  additionally, the face pedal was adjustable, as well as travel range and pedal angle
  adjustable pedal face was interesting, could allow pedal face swaps - long face (for heel toe) and shorter face
  
  Cons
  bell crank will require more testing
  honestly idk how the mechanism really works and i cant see how it works when the bell crank moves
  maybe no hydraulic dampers
  
  Conclusion:
  Further research on bell crank

HU+
  Nice - must be the premium sounding name
  It just looks good
  load cell is at an angle to the spring rod
  adjustable hydraulic dampeners
  upon a quick search
  what stood out to me was the resisted extension of the damper
  allowing for a slower return which could help improve trail braking 
  also i thought it was nice that the wires were thick and protruded from the sides - will note thick wires
  pedal plate anchors and pedal adjusters not connected in as one plate - could save materials
  paired bolts along pedal arm - decorative or structural?
  Uses elastomers
  what also caught my eyes were the hinges/pivot between the pedal arm and the base as the VRS pedals werent so straightforward
  With the help of Google's nano banana, I was able to get a nice diagram showing the breakdown of the parts
  <img width="1344" height="768" alt="image" alt="hallucination???" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf6136ef-7113-43e9-80c3-4885ccd3bbfa" />
  Will probably be using the nano banana in the future
  
  Cons
  Lacked the customizability of the VRS
  the angle between load cell and spring rod was a grey area

The others followed virtually the same pattern as the HU+ so the descriptions wont be too detailed

SIMNET
Very similar to HU+ with dampeners and elastomer setup
Not much to learn from
though the clearer division from two pieces allowed me to learn that the load cell acts as a bridge between two separate parts (plate and spring rod)

SIMJACK
Side profile provided easiest brake down
very very similar to simnet 
However - the lack of structural cutouts stood out to me

VNM
Least number of bolts on pedal arm
load cell setup was easiest to grasp
however - as it is direct perpendicular to the springrod
sustainability and wear and tear should be taken into consideration

# Overall #
The design and structure of the pedal arm should be studied with the help of nano banana
Bell-crank mechanism must be investigated further
learn about structural cutouts

What should be part of the final piece:
VRS route:
  Contained most features of HU+ so not much to talk about
  Nice hinges
  Considered the hydraulic dampers but may compromise the smooth feeling of the pedals (quite highly talked about feature)

HU+ ish route:
  Adjustable pedal face
  Adjustable hydraulic damper angle
  Pedal ratio? Consider integrity
  Hot swappable elastomers

Foot rest; height adjust; INTEGRITY AND SAFETY <- Important
